# Stages and Actions

The form can be divided into stages, each with its own set of rules and permissions. This allows for a more dynamic and
flexible form that can change based on the stage of the process.

## Stage

### Using stages
As name suggests, stages are the different steps in a workflow. By default, there are two stages:
- **Start** - the initial stage of the form, which is accessible to users with `Initiator` role.
- **Submitted** - the stage after the form has been submitted, which is accessible to users with `Administator` role.
