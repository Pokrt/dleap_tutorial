# Page visibility in certain stages

## Overview

The visibility of a page can be controlled by the stage in which it is displayed. This is useful for
creating dynamic forms that change based on the stage of the process. This can be used in combinations with different
roles. For example, a form may have a visible set of pages for the "New" stage than for the "Approved" stage.

## Stage-based visibility
Sometimes you may want to change the visibility of the whole page in certain stage.
