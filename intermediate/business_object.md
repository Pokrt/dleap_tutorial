# Object Model

The term business object refers to a software concept that represents a business entity with its attributes and methods.
It is used to model the business domain in software applications.
Business objects are used to represent real-world entities such as customers, products, orders, and employees, and they
encapsulate the data and behavior associated with these entities.

## Representation

In HCL Domino Leap, business objects are represented as forms with input fields. Each field on the form corresponds to
an attribute of the business object, and the form itself represents the business object as a whole.
