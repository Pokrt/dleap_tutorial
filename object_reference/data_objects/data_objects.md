# Data Objects in Domino Leap

## Key Concepts

1. **Business Object (BO)**: Represents an instance of a form, containing all the data. It's the primary object you'll
   interact with when dealing with form data.

2. **Business Object Attribute (BOA)**: Represents individual data items mapped to form elements, like input fields or
   checkboxes.

3. **Business Object List (BOL)**: A collection of Business Objects, used primarily with table items where each row
   represents a Business Object in the list.
