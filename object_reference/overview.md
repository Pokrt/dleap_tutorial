# Overview

In this section, you can find all JavaScript objects in Domino Leap and their respective methods. In contrast to the official HCL product documentation, we provice the content in more comprehencive way. We belive that our version is better structured, more visually appealing and far easier to use. 
The content has been extracted from HCL Documentation and transformed using AI tools. It was a one-time procedure that brought content related to Domino Leap 1.1.3. Since then the pages are updated manually and therefore the content might be slightly behind the official site. In case of any doubts allways refer to the official documentation! If you find any error in this chapter, feel free to submit a correction via GitHub pull request or create an [Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Pokrt/dleap_tutorial/issues).
