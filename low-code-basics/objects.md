# Objects in HCL Domino Leap

In HCL Domino Leap, objects are used to represent various elements of the application, such as pages, forms, and data.
There are two types of objects - Interface Objects and Data Objects. Components (mainly called objects) can consist of
both types of objects or only one type. Whether an object is an Interface Object or both depends on the context in which
it is used. When it is placed on an app page, it is just an Interface Object and called `appItem`. When it is placed
into form, it is both an Interface Object and a Data Object and called `item`.
