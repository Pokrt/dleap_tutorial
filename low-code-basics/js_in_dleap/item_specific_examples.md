# Item-specific Examples

In this section, you will learn how to work with item-specific events. These events are specific to only some types of objects, such as buttons, datagrids, surveys, and more. Here are examples of some of them:

### Buttons
Suppose you have a button in your application that, by default, says "Submit." After a user performs a certain action,
you want to change this label to "Continue." Here's how you would use `item.setContent(content)` to achieve that:

```javascript
var submitButton = item; // Assume 'item' refers to your button item
submitButton.setContent("Continue");
```

In this example, the label on the button originally assigned to the variable `submitButton` will change from "Submit"
to "Continue." This demonstrates how you can dynamically update the content of a button to reflect the current state of
your application or guide the user through a multi-step process.


### Datagrids
Suppose you have a datagrid in your application that displays a list of items. You want to get the data in the datagrid:
```javascript
console.log(appPage.F_DataGrid1.getDisplayedData())
```


### Surveys
We want to obtain the options of a survey item:
```javascript
let options = item.getOptions();
// Retrieves an array of options for survey questions, each with a value and display property.
```

### Dropdown
Suppose you have a dropdown item and you want to set values to it:
```javascript
var theTitle = "";
var opts = page.F_DropDown.getOptions();
for(var i=0; i<opts.length; i++) {
  var theItemTitle = get(get(opts,i), 'title');
  var theItemValue = get(get(opts,i), 'value');
  if(theItemValue === 'Red') {
    theTitle = theItemTitle;
  }
}
```
